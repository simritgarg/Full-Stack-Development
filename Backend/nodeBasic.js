// nodejs is not a programming language , not a library, not a framework, not a technology then what is nodejs
// nodejs is the runtime environment
// we will write the code in js then pass it to the wrapper class which will the convert the js code to cpp which will pass it to engine v8 which 
// whose source code is written in the cpp as with the cpp module we will help to create the server (ie it will take the 
// js module and then with help of engine v8 cpp module it will use to create the server)
// so node js is the js wrapper + v8 engine

// nodejs is the js runtime environment as js is not capable to make the backend so there introduce the nodejs to make the 
// backend with javascript

// npm is basically the module where we can take the code without writing it again
